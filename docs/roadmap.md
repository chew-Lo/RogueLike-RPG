# Roadmap

## MVP (Sprint 2)
- Class selection (Warrior, Archer, Wizard)
- Basic battle system with auto-combat
- Enemy waves with scaling difficulty
- Health bars and battle log
- Simple stat upgrades after victories
- Local score saving
- Top 3 leaderboard

## Full Version (Sprint 3)
- Skill system with 12 unlockable abilities
- 20% chance for skills to activate automatically
- Enemy skills that also activate randomly
- 20% healing after each victory
- Multiple enemy types with different abilities
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Polish and balance improvements

## Risks
1. **Skill balance** - Some skills might be too strong/weak
2. **Progression pacing** - Waves might get too hard too fast
3. **Performance** - Many skills active could slow the game

**Simple Goal**: Make a fun auto-battle game where you choose a class, fight enemies, unlock cool skills, and try to get on the leaderboard.
